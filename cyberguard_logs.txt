2025-04-04 19:16:52.965978 - LOG: Failed password for root from 192.168.1.7 port 22 ssh2
RESPONSE:


1. Suspicious (Yes/No): No
Why: The log entry indicates a failed password attempt for the root user on a remote server using SSH. This is a common occurrence and is not necessarily suspicious in itself.
2. Should Block IP (Yes/No): No
Why: There is no indication that the IP address of the attempted login should be blocked.
3. Severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical): Medium
Why: While a failed password attempt for the root user is not necessarily critical, it can still represent a potential security risk if the user attempting the login has malicious intentions. Therefore, it is considered a medium-level severity event.
